Soap &amp; Rest Service Dashboard
=================

This is a utility to ping and quickly identify the status of SOAP and REST endpoints.  This project uses [Grails](http://grails.org/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
to accomplish this easily and with style.

The project comes wired with a few examples of SOAP and REST endpoints.  One of these is intentionally set to fail to show a failure view.
